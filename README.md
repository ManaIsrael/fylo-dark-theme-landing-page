## Acknowledgments

I Always Love to Acknowledge Mother of God Saint Virgin Mary, I wouldn't even know what my passion and luck is if I hadn't prayed unto her. Next I would Love to acknowledge my Mother Sara fekadu who encouraged me to keep up with my passion, without her advice, I wouldn't be here doing web development rather I would just stick to not failing on exams in college.
